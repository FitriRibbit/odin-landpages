1. Index. html made with menu bar which have fixed position, description section, project section, about section and footer. I am using some CSS tag for made page more colorful. I made with brown and peru color. Most of the section from this page infiltrate flexbox knowledge to made it. Every section have height around 300px. Every menu from Home until about will get direct to section based on their title. Except for Source menu in navbar, its directed to source page.
